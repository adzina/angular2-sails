This skeleton also contains an example of integration between Sails Api and Angular 4

# First installation (Production)

Open Command Prompt to Execute Commands

`cd /`

`git clone https://github.com/Giancarlo1974/SailsAngular.git SingleAppPage`

`cd SingleAppPage`

`npm install`

`ng build --aot --prod`

It's compile angular in /dist folder

`node app.js` (optional: If you want only Angular, skip this step)

If you have any errors, see the section "Typical errors" at the bottom of the page

# Development
`ng serve` -> run angular client http://localhost:4200

`node app.js` (optional for node js server) -> run server node http://localhost:1337/ + Grunt Task Automation + Database

## To create a new angular component:
`ng generate component nomeComponente`

## To create a new angular service:
`ng generate service nomeServizio`

## To create a new sails controller:
`sails generate controller nomeController`

# Bootstrap 4
It's use scss ( .angular-cli.json file )

"styles": [

  "../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap.scss",

  "./xxxxxxxx.scss"

],

See this bootstrap components

# Node JS (Optional)
This part is optional: it is only for those who want to use a Node Server.

Sails is the most popular MVC framework for Node.js, designed to emulate the familiar MVC pattern of frameworks like Ruby on Rails, but with support for the requirements of modern apps: data-driven APIs with a scalable, service-oriented architecture.

Here you can read some of its features

http://sailsjs.com/

Sails.js is one of the best MVC framework and can help you to rapidly develop web applications. For those who donâ€™t want to reinvent the wheel like we do in the MEAN stack, Sails is a great option.

# Database
You can choose the most popular databases (Postgres, Oracle, and MySQL, MongoDB, Redis, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, etc)

see \config\connectios.js for configuration



# API
To create new api, for example http://localhost:1337/employee launch this command:

sails generate api Employee

See the files:

/api/models/Employee.js

/api/controllers/EmployeeController.js

## to create new record
http://localhost:1337/employee/create?fullname=a&emailid=xyz@abc.com&phonenumber=1234

## to get the list
http://localhost:1337/employee/

http://localhost:1337/employee/?limit=1

http://localhost:1337/employee/?limit=10&sort=emailid%20desc

## to update
http://localhost:1337/employee/update/1?fullname=ciccio&emailid=abc@abc.com

# Typical errors
## ng command not found
`npm install -g @angular/cli`

( I recommend @ )

`ng -v`

## EADDRINUSE Is something else already running on port 1337 ?

type this command for change port

`set PORT=8081`

And then try to run the server again

`node app.js`
